# data_zoomcamp


This repo contains homework and code for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub) by Datatalks.Club.


## Architecture

During the course I will be using the following architecture:

* [New York's Taxi and Limousine Corporation's Trip Records Dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page): the dataset used
* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/): analytics engine for large-scale data processing (distributed processing).
* [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/products/bigquery/): serverless _data warehouse_ (central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources).
* [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/): workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. In other words, a pipeline orchestration tool.
* [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/): unified, high-throughput,low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds (streaming).
